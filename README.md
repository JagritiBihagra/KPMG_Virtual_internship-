Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMGâ€™s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 
Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. 

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

Customer Demographic 
Customer Addresses
Transactions data in the past 3 months

After analyzing the data , we did EDA to get a better insights about the data. I have used excel to improve quality, accuracy, relevancy of data provided. Used RFM(Recency,frequency,monetary) analysis for better understanding about the customers' behaviour.
In the next, task used tableau for the visualization. Hence, created a dashboard highloghting about the major KPIs of the business. We have made analysis about the top 10 selling bikes, customers. And demographic analysis.
